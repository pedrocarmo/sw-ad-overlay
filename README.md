sw-ad-overlay
=============

An ad overlayer for Wordpress

What does it do
=============

You get an overlay takeover (with a sort of shadowbox thing behind) when you open any page.

Mostly designed for ads, but can pretty much be used for any takeover style overlay you may want to do -- featured posts, etc.


INSTALATION
=============

Add to your plugin folder as with most WP plugins.

Configuration of the plugin should be straightforward in its options page.
